Hi,

We need you to check the factual accuracy of changes made to ‘Statutory Neonatal Care Pay and Leave: employer guide’ before it’s published on GOV.UK.

The GOV.UK Content Team made the changes because

# Deadline: 15 April 2025 (5 working days from today - 8 April 2025)

Preview the changes:
https://draft-origin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/employers-neonatal-care-pay-leave?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiI1Yzg1OGQyOC1iODc3LTRlN2ItYTU5Ni04MjdkZTNkODI0MGIiLCJjb250ZW50X2lkIjoiYjU0MTBiZDYtMTA2OS00MmViLTlhMjAtMjQ3NThjYTE1NzA4IiwiaWF0IjoxNzQ0MTIxNzk5LCJleHAiOjE3NDY3MTM3OTl9.T05_RFesBeNUyaE_c1TuXie6A6VTJlVTKuJ6k5NHgUY

---------------------------------------------------

# What to do

Reply and confirm the content is correct.

Or, if you spot something that's not correct, reply to this email and tell us:

- which paragraph or section isn’t right - for example chapter 2, under heading ‘How much it costs’
- what’s wrong and why - for example the text implies a legal obligation, when there isn't one

Check your reply is being sent to govuk-fact-check-integration@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk. Do not remove [67f2dd70036d59001480c74c] from the subject line - GDS will not get your fact check response if this is removed.

---------------------------------------------------

# How to do it

When fact checking, please:

- only point out factual errors - don’t suggest wording (GDS is responsible for the style)
- use plain text - GDS systems don’t display text formatting, colours or attachments

To get the content published more quickly:

- only include comments about sections that GDS has changed
- only reply once - it’ll help if you co-ordinate your response before replying

---------------------------------------------------

# When to contact your GOV.UK lead

Ask your GOV.UK lead if:

- you’ve spotted a new issue - they’ll raise a new request with GDS
- you’ve got any questions - they can ask GDS any queries via the Zendesk system
- you need an extension to the deadline

Thank you.</textarea>
